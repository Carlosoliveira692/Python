#Primeiro projeto Python do Carlos: (31/01/2022, 20:30)
#Este projeto não teve recurso a nenhum toturial e foi só usando conhecimentos até à data adquiridos)

#Carlos Calculator:

#Menu:
print("--Welcome to Carlos Personalized Calculator--\nPlease choose a operation to execute:")
menu = print("0- Exit\n01- Addition\n02- Subtraction\n03- Multiplication\n04- Division")
selection = input("What type of operation do you want to solve?\nOperation Number: ")
if (selection) > str("04"):
  print("!!!You haven't choose any available option, please retry and select one of the options above.!!!")
if (selection) < str("0"):
  print("!!!You haven't choose any available option, please retry and select one of the options above.!!!")

#For Exit:
if (selection) == str("0"):
  print("")

#For additions:
number1 = "Insert here the first number of the operation: "
number2 = "Insert here the second number of the operation: "
if (selection) == str("01"): 
 result1 = int(input(number1)) + int(input(number2))
 print("The result of your operation is: " + str(result1))

#For subtractions:
number3 = "Insert here the first number of the operation: "
number4 = "Insert here the second number of the operation: "
if (selection) == str("02"): 
 result2 = int(input(number3)) - int(input(number4))
 print("The result of your operation is: " + str(result2))

#For multiplications:
number5 = "Insert here the first number of the operation: "
number6 = "Insert here the second number of the operation: "
if (selection) == str("03"): 
 result3 = int(input(number5)) * int(input(number6))
 print("The result of your operation is: " + str(result3))

#For divisions:
number7 = "Insert here the first number of the operation: "
number8 = "Insert here the second number of the operation: "
if (selection) == str("04"): 
 result4 = int(input(number7)) / int(input(number8))
 print("The result of your operation is: " + str(result4))
